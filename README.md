# 🐾 Katy-Feeder

**Katy-Feeder** is a smart feeding solution designed to help cats 🐱 maintain a healthy weight, especially after sterilization, when the risk of obesity increases.

The system monitors the cat's weight at each meal ⚖️ and automatically dispenses the appropriate amount of food 🍽️ to support a balanced diet. In addition to controlled feeding, the feeder also includes an auto-refilling water bowl 💧 to ensure constant hydration.

Our goal is to make it easier for pet owners to take care of their cats' health 🧡 in a simple and convenient way, keeping their furry friends happy, active, and well-nourished.
